The purpose of this project is to review and revisit old skills in Web-Dev. 
Refresher course to recall the use of HTML, CSS, and JS. 

## Steps for project: form_validator

1. Create the README file 
2. Create the HTML file 
3. Create the CSS file
4. Create the JS file 
5. Setup the standard boilerplate syntax for all files
6. Create comments in all file types 
7. Apply extensions that we will use within the project 
    * JS | ES6- Snippets
    * Auto Tag Rename
    * Live Server
------------------------------------------------------
8. Create the outline of our HTML file
9. Save and test HTML
10. Create outlline of our CSS file
11. Save and test CSS
------------------------------------------------------

23. Start with creating our constant (variables)
24. Build the event listener to look for and listen to 
25. Create additional varaibles to align with event listener
26. Save changes. Run and test all code
------------------------------------------------------
27. After testing the site- found a minor bug in the form (password was visible)
28. In source HTML code updated the input type for the fourth field in the form changed type= text to type= password

31. Save changes. Run and test new JavaScript code
32. Create new function to check that the email is a valid email
33. Learn how to research and use Stack Overflow to locate pre-made code snippets or scripts that are already built
------------------------------------------------------
34. Troubleshoot/ debug why the function is not working
35. found that the function synctax was not formatted properly. Repair function 
36. Save changes. Run and test the new code
------------------------------------------------------
37. Learn what how to reffne and refactor or JavaScript code
38. Where to start? --> We will refine the if/ else conditionals within our script
39. Refine and refactor our code to simplify how mamy lines of code we are creating and simplify repetitions

    # Code Removed and Refactored: 
    /* THIS IS WHERE WE STARTED WITH THIS FORM CREATION
-----------------------------------------------------
    if (username.value == '') {
        showError(username, 'Username is required')

41. Save changes. Run and test new JavaScript
------------------------------------------------------
42. Apply additional checks within the JavaScript
43. Checks for the password length (min and max)
44. Save changes. Run and test JavaScript code
------------------------------------------------------
45. Refine and refactor the code so that the checks are applied to all fieldname input id
46. Make some adjustments to the initial function that we created to check the email regex
47. Create a check to make sure that the passwords are matching
48. Create additional HTML code to create a Reset Button
49. Create additional CSS code to syle this button a bit differently from the submit button
49. Lookup function to reset a form. Embed the code snippet and format to fit the naming convention that we are working with
50. Save changes. Run and test code
------------------------------------------------------
## This completes the form_validator project
